    Since the day it was founded in 1882, the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society set itself the objective of providing charity and aid to the local populations residing in the Holy Land. In the beginning of the Society’s statute, with which the Society  was approved, it is written: “The Orthodox Society is established for purposes of science and charity”, going on saying, “to found schools, hospitals, guest houses and hostels, and also provide aid to local residents”.

    The means, resources and general level of life in Russia at the time, an empire at its economical and intellectual peak, is only but a dream for Palestine’s inhabitants; at that time they were living under the declining Ottoman Empire’s rule that not long later will be erased from the region.
    
    <b>Educational activity</b>
    
    Various denominations of Christianity have been present in Jerusalem and Palestine ever since the very beginning of Christianity.
    In 19th-century Palestine the lack of Orthodox education for the believers’ children was evident. Numerous children are compelled to study in educational frameworks that are not in accordance with their faith. The Society performs immediately in order to open schools and faces plenty of obstacles devised by the Turkish authorities. Despite of it all, on December 6th 1882 the first school was inaugurated in Nazareth with one teacher and thirty students.
    The project accomplishes great success and acclamation from the local community and thus more schools are opened all around the Galilee. Part of the Society’s goal is to open a school in Jerusalem, too, but the Greek Patriarch opposes it. Therefore the IPPO progresses opening schools in the regions of Yehuda, the Galilee and not only in the land of Israel but also in Syria and Lebanon.
    The school in Nazareth turns into a complex in which students and teachers live in boarding-school standards and also an infirmary operates covering the medical needs not only of the school but also the area’s locals. The school gradually turns into a teachers’ seminar in order to train teachers for all the rest of the Society’s schools.
    Any community interested to take advantage of the quality of Russian education would gather donations, allocated a plot of land to be used for the erection of a building for the school, in case there is no other available building. All the rest was the Society’s responsibility, especially the teachers but also desks chairs, textbooks, notebooks, etc.
    The curriculum of the studies included a series of subjects and not only religious Orthodox teachings. The objective was to provide the children values and professions that suit their natural environment and that will serve them in the future; as a result, great emphasis was placed in environmental studies, Arabic and mathematics. The schools would evoke a pleasant feeling to any observer, they were characterized as orderly and organized, the students would go back to their families full of praises and thus Russian presence is dearly appreciated by the local community.
    The next large educational complex is opened in Beit Jala, in Jerusalem’s suburbs. It is founded in a similar format as the one of the school in Nazareth and, also in this school complex, an infirmary is operated, a church and dormitories for the students and teachers, who also here live according to boarding-school standards. This school is opened thanks to the donation of the Tsarina at the time, Maria Feodorovna. The school is intended for womens’ education and teacher training in order to fill teaching positions in IPPO’s schools all over the Levant. The first class began studying in the school in 1890. Teachers that had undergone training in Nazareth and Beit Jala would also go through first-aid training and basic medicine studies; after the completion of their training, the were obliged to work in the Society’s infirmaries, as well.
    
    Apart from caring for the teaching level in the Society’s numerous schools, the Society also cared to equate the teachers’ employment conditions to the ones of the teachers in the Russian Empire.
    In 1901 the Society member and prospective deputy chairman of the IPPO, Nikolai Milievich Anichkov arrived to Palestine to inspect the schools and wrote “I am compelled to sincerely admit that I traveled to the Holy Land thinking that all these schools, about which several has been said and written, are more to be found in one’s imagination. However, when I saw them, I was persuaded that not only they exist but also many of them are holding a standard similar to that of Russian schools”.
    The educational operation of the Society is crowned with success and 25 years after its creation, in 1907, the Society operates 101 schools in the Middle East – 5 in the Yehuda region (466 students), 19 in the Galilee (723 students), 50 in southern Syria (5,063 students) and 5 in Beirut (1,018 students). Among these schools, there were 48 schools of one class, 51 of two classes and two teachers’ seminars, in Nazareth for males and in Beit Jala for females.
    
    <b>Medical Aid</b>

    Starting around the middle of the 19th century and until WWI, the pilgrimage movement to the Holy Land continually grows and it is notable that many pilgrims are older adults and even elderly people. The exhausting journey from all over the Russian Empire’s territories towards Jerusalem charged its price on the pilgrims.
    The medical services provided by the Turkish authorities at the time were very scarce and were granted mainly to Ottoman citizens. In the same time, hospitals opened by Western nations conditioned their medical treatment with participation of the patient in the sermons delivered by Western Churches.
    The need for self-sustained medical services is clear, and thus in 1863 the  hospital in Jerusalem is inaugurated. The hospital constituted the culmination of the Society’s humanitarian activity. It was built under the order of Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna; it was equipped with the most novel equipment of the period including blood transfusion machines, gastric lavage equipment and valuable surgical tools.
    An IOPS inspector wrote that “The order and cleanliness can compete with the most excellent of hospitals”.
    After a severe infectious epidemic originated in the hospital in 1883, a special department for the treatment of contagious diseases was opened two years later. Since 1899 surgical operations were performed in the hospital and in the annual report of that year it was recorded that ten successful surgeries had been performed in the hospital.
    In its inauguration day, the hospital contained thirty beds and its occupancy gradually grew; in 1887 the hospital contained 75 beds and was the largest in Jerusalem.
    Between 1884 and 1887 the Russian pilgrims constituted approximately 55%  of the total number of patients treated by the hospital; the rest were part of the poorest local population of Jerusalem.
    Every pilgrim paid a hospitalization fee of one ruble and received all the necessary medical treatment free of charge. The rest of the money needed for the operation of the hospital was raised from donations offered by Russia’s high society.
    Between 14% and 50% of all the pilgrims found themselves in need of medical attention at some point of their pilgrimage joourney in the Holy Land.
    In 1888 an additional infirmary was opened in Nazareth as part of the school complex, where the teachers underwent first-aid training and also contributed to the infirmary’s management.
    In 1890 another infirmary is opened, this time in the school complex of Beit Jala similar to the one in Nazareth; these infirmaries provide medical attention and aid to the local populations, as well.
    In 1911 the hospital in Jerusalem treated 22,000 patients. Overall, all the Society’s medical centers in Palestine and the Middle East (Holy Land, Syria, Levanon) had recorded 100,000 cases that had been treated during that year.

    “For the sake of Zion I will not be silent and for the sake of Jerusalem I will not rest” - Isaiah 62:1
This verse is taken from the Old Testament and is inscribed upon the emblem of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society and expresses a deep, powerful and long-established connection between the Russian people and the Holy Land along with all its holy sites to Christianity.
This affinity to the Holy Land constitutes the guideline from the simplest of peasants, through the community priests, to the middle class and the rest of the social and religious hierarchy to the head of the Empire.
The IOPS – Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society (Russian: ИППО – Импера́торское правосла́вное палести́нское о́бщество) is a scientific and humanitarian organization that was formally established in 1882 after almost a century of Russian activity in the Holy Land and around a thousand years of Christianity in the Russian Empire.
Education, medicine, archaeology, support to Orthodox pilgrims in their journeys comprise only a part of the objectives the Society sets to itself, which will be achieved during the years to come. The Society plays a vital role to the return of Jerusalem to its natural condition as the epicenter of the three monotheistic religions – Jewry, Christianity and Islam.
In the rise of the 19th century Jerusalem, with its 2,500 years of history, stands neglected and forgotten, as a part of the ancient world that did not manage to perform the transition to modern times that characterized other European cities. The Ottoman Empire, which has been ruling the city for around 400 years (since 1517), is experiencing an economical and cultural decline that ultimately brings to the end of the Empire’s sovereignty over the Middle East.

The ruins of the Muristan square and the church of the Holy Sepulchre – 1860.

“In spite of the myriads of crippled people, the defect and the ill flocking to the holy sites, blocking the gates, one can think that ancient times revive and that the Angel of God is about to come any minute and boil the water of the Bethesda pool. Jerusalem is a dull, desolate and lifeless city. I will not desire to dwell in it.” - Mark Twain, 1867.
The idea of pilgrimage journeys to the holy sites in the land of Israel and Jerusalem is deeply rooted in the Russian people. Numerous songs, stories and adventures are being told in family homes and ignite the listeners’ imagination. Christian faith constitutes the common denominator among all levels of society – peasants and laborers, writers and artists, educated and high-society people and up to the royal family itself.
The journey to Jerusalem from Russia was a dangerous and very expensive venture for hundrends of years, including riding donkeys or horses for thousands of kilometers. A few people only made the  journey and only part of them returned.
The invention of the steamboat in the 19th century makes the journey to the Holy Land accessible to many believers, who can now fulfill the hundreds of years old dream, to see with their own eyes the land on which Jesus walked. A journey of several weeks was reduced at least by half the time, but the journey still remained challenging. Pilgrims from Russia did not speak Arabic, the prevalent language in Palestine, and were not knowledgeable of the ways of the East. Despite the dangers entailed in the quest, the pilgrims trend became stronger by the year.
Contrary to Jerusalem and the Ottoman Empire, the Christian powers are at the peak of the industrial revolution. Priests and nuns, government representatives, architects, pilgrims and visionaries begin to slowly flow into the city since the beginning of the 19th century. The trend of European visitors gradually turns into a surge that will get to its apex in the beginning of the 20th century; eventually it will stop by the outbreak of WWI.
This way, by the middle of the 19th century numerous Russian pilgrims make their way to Jerusalem and Palestine. They encounter several difficulties and are exposed to harassment and fraud from the local population. Government and church  representatives of the Russian Empire sent in those years report back that there is a dire need to protect Russian pilgrims who get to Palestine. Moreover, they report that the presence of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Holy Land is weakening and is in need of support from the Empire. 
The Russian Empire led by the tsarist family, who are faithful Christians, see in the development of the connection to the Near East a political interest, as well, whose objective is to avoid the further expansion of the West.
The Russian Orthodox Church dispatches delegates to help the local Orthodox Church and simultaneously provide for the Russian believers’ needs that perform the quest to the Holy Land.
As such, Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna and her husband Tsar Alexander II aid with considerable donations and get the Russian public triggered to help, too, by donating money to the Church. As a collective effort, land plots in Jerusalem are bought and on them several buildings are constructed, such as hostels for pilgrims, permanent buildings for the Russian Consulate and religious missions. Nevertheless, the pilgrimage journey is getting more and more popular, and the buildings already constructed to host the pilgrims are not sufficient, resulting in many people sleeping in the corridors or even in tents outside the buildings.
The need to concentrate all the action under one umbrella-organization is born; this organization needs to be neither governmental nor of the Church so that it can perform under the watchful eye of the Ottoman rule.
The idea gets on the paper for the first time by the hand of a junior government official that reaches Palestine as a sojourner and pilgrim – Vasily Nikolayevich Khitrovo. After multiple efforts, he manages to persuade Russia’s visionary priest in Palestine, Fr. Antonin Kapustin, to found such an organization. Together they accomplish to recruit the Grand Duke Sergey Alexandrovich, brother of Tsar Alexander III, to be the head of the Society and establish a statute for it, certified by the Tsar himself.
On May 21st 1882 the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society (IOPS) is inaugurated in an ultimately impressive ceremony.
The first undertaking of the IOPS is the unification of the Russian assets in the Holy Land that are controlled by various factors, under a unitary direction in order to achieve more efficient logistic activity. Among the different buildings one can discern Alexander’s Courtyard in the old city of Jerusalem, the pilgrims hostel in honor of Maria Alexandrovna, the Holy Trinity Cathedral and more.
The organization has to cope with the pre-WWI Ottoman rule, which was known to be based on a complex bureaucratic system.
By the end of the 19th century the pilgrimage movement is expanding year by year, and reaches 4,000 pilgrims per annum. During this period the buildings under Russian control in the Holy Land can host a thousand pilgrims in full occupancy.
The organization acts immediately towards the erection of edifices designated to host the ever-increasing numbers of pilgrims. On the land plot of the Russian Compound three principal buildings are erected for the accommodation of pilgrims, the leading one being Sergey’s Courtyard that is intended for Russia’s high-society visitors. Moreover, a men’s hostel was constructed in the name of Nikolai II and another hostel for pilgrims in Jaffa.
Apart from pilgrims’ accommodation, the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society sets the goal of providing aid to the local inhabitants of the Holy Land, to the churches, to the monasteries and the clergy and also raise schools, hospitals and shelters in the Holy Land.
Schools are built in Nazareth and Beit Jala, a hospital in Jerusalem, where pilgrims that get treatment constitute less than 50% of the people treated. Moreover, the Society digs more than 2 kilometers of sewage pipeline in Jerusalem and manages to supply its own potable water via usage of a system of water pits and rainwater harvesting.
The Society also builds churches that magnificently integrate in the landscape of Jerusalem and excite visitors to this day – the Holy Trinity church, the church of Mary Magdalene, the church of All-Saints in Ein Karem and more.
Saint Peterburg’s high society begins to get very interested in visiting the Holy Land owing to the Society’s extensive activity of spreading the word about it in Russia.
Since 1897, the Society organizes lectures on holy sites in Palestine as a preparation for the pilgrimage journey in the Holy Land. Thousands arrive to the lectures and five years later, the total number of people that had attended these preparatory lectures came up to five million.
The churches chosen to host these lectures are far from being able to contain the enormous numbers of people and, having no other choice, the lectures are carried out in the open sky.

The manifest of the IOPS approved by the Holy Synod in 1882

A complementary objective of the organization is the provision of Russian Orthodox quality education for the Orthodox communities of the Middle East.
The Society detects a severe inadequacy in Orthodox education in the Christian Levant and invest a lot of resources on the development of education in the region.
Initially, the solution implemented by the Society was granting financial aid, but later it progressed to the founding of schools and appointing its own educational staff. In December 6th 1882, after very serious efforts that eventually entailed the chairman of the Society, Grand Duke Sergey Alexandrovich, the first school in the Holy Land on behalf of the IOPS is created with one teacher and thirty students; this is the point the Society starts acting as a humanitarian – educational body in the Holy Land.
By the completion of the 25th anniversary since the establishment of the Society, in 1907, its educational operations already included 101 schools stretching from Syria in the north to Beit Jala in the south.
The principal goal of the Society was to provide aid to pilgrims that fulfill the dream of setting foot at the holy Christian sites.
The IOPS accompanies the pilgrims in their epic journey from their village in Russia up until Jerusalem by issuing a special passport that grants them a subsidy, as most pilgrims cannot afford this expensive sojourn. It began with a ride on a steamboat from Odessa to the port of Jaffa, from there a road ride to Jerusalem and then to all the holy places on which Jesus Christ walked. Upon the pilgrims’ arrival to Jerusalem, they are hosted in the buildings constructed especially for them, which are collectively known to every citizen of Jerusalem as the “Russian Compound”. The are provided with food and medical services at cost prices.
Accompanied by certified escorts, the pilgrims travel in big groups to the holy sites about which they had only read in books and heard in prayers before, from the sea of Galilee in the north until the Dead sea in the south.
Here our quest begins to follow the footsteps of these people that accomplished this wonderful journey that they dreamt of.

    hitrovo: `
    Vasily Nikolayevich Khitrovo was a statesman and public figure in the Russian Empire during mid-19th  century. He was the visionary and initiator of the foundation of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society; some kind of Herzl for Orthodox Christianity that got to see his vision materialized.

Khitrovo was born in 1834 in Saint-Peterburg and he performs his first-ever visit in Palestine in 1871 as a pilgrim; one that gets remarkably impressed by the Land of Israel, or better said, got passionate about it.
Khitrovo composes his book “A week in Palestine, from travel memories” narrating his adventures. Over the course of his visit he dedicated his time to the identification of the Russian pilgrims’ needs in the Holy Land and investigates what are the necessary measures the Empire has to take in order to 
reinforce its influence in the region. Khitrovo recognizes the need of the establishment of a non-governmental organization so that feelings of antagonism are avoided from the Ottoman rule. In Khitrovo’s vision the organization would strengthen and re-establish the influence of the Russian Empire and the Russian Orthodox Church in Palestine, while competing with the Great Powers and the Churches of the West that also reinforce their presence in Jerusalem at the time. 
In Palestine he meets one of the men of the religious mission, Archimandrite Antonin Kapustin, and a bold and solid friendship is developed between the two. Khitrovo and Kapustin travel on horses around the region of Galilee and exchange ideas, opinions and ideologies.
Khitrovo delves further into the concept of an organization operating for the sake of the church and the Russian pilgrims reaching the Holy Land, thus he wrote his ideas down and hands the document over to Antonin Kapustin. At the same time, he contacts the former head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Palestine, Archimandrite Leonid Kavelin, who was at the time head of the “New Jerusalem” (Novo-Jerusalimsky) Monastery located in Moscow.
Khitrovo’s ideas are initially not welcomed by the circles of the Church, as well as by his friend Kapustin, who rejected the idea at first. Only two years after this introductory proposal, Kapustin decides to invest all his energies for the realization of the idea. Kapustin gets in contact with Count E. V. Putyatin and introduces him to Khitrovo and the new idea of founding a non-governmental organization for Palestine. The Count gets passionate about it, presents it to the high society in Saint-Peterburg and encourages its materialization.
Khitrovo proposes a set of articles of association for the organization and submits it for confirmation to the supervisor of the Holy Synod, Konstantin Pobedonostsev. Simultaneously, Count Putyatin gets a copy of the articles of association and begins gathering signatures from the “right people”, the most prominent of whom is the Duke Sergey Alexandrovich that is willing to accept to serve as the first chairman of the Society. The primary signature featured in the document containing the articles of association is that of Tsar Alexander III.
In May 21st, 1882 the Orthodox Palestine Society is an undisputed fact. In time, it will be called Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society (Russian -  Импера́торское правосла́вное палести́нское о́бщество, abbrev. -  ИППО) in order to outline the connection to the royal family.
By the time the Society was established Khitrovo was appointed deputy chairman of the Society under the chairman Prince Sergey. He served at this position until 1889 and subsequently was appointed secretary of the Society, a position which he held until his last day in 1903. Khitrovo was buried in Saint-Peterburg.

“Don’t extinguish the spirit” - such a testament was left to his followers in the IOPS by Vasily Nikolayevich Khitrovo
 During his days Khitrovo published, with the Society’s assistance, seven books, all of which focus in the Holy Land and the holy sites:
●      "The scientific significance of the excavations carried out by the Orthodox Palestinian society in the Russian place near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem" (St. Petersburg, 1885)
●      “A week in Palestine. From Traveling Memories ”(ib., 1879)
●      “Palestine and the Sinai” ( issue I, ib., 1876 ; issue II, ib., 1886)
●      "Orthodoxy in the Holy Land" (St. Petersburg, 1881)
●      Light, truth and the peoples of Russia of all times, or The complete history of the Russian state.
●      "Letters of the Holy Land" (St. Petersburg, 1898)
●      “Russian pilgrims of the Holy Land” (ib., 1905).

  openingParagraph: `
  Between the years 1850 and 1917 the Russian Empire together with the Russian Orthodox Church erected tens of buildings all over the Middle East and especially in the area of Palestine. During these years, the industrial revolution and the progress that were surging through the West were awaiting to reach our region. In the same period, as in the whole millennium of Christianity in Russia, the Russian people feel a deep connection to the Holy Land and the holy sites of Christianity.
Remarkable amounts of money and resources were invested in Palestine by the state and the people of Russia and they were principally allocated to the construction of churches and monasteries, as well as to the creation of the foundations for the sake of the Russian believers who are drawn to the constantly expanding movement of pilgrimage to Jerusalem every year.
All the aforementioned contributed significantly to the development of the Land of Israel. The influence of all this activity is recognized until today; magnificent churches adorn the Israeli landscape, governmental buildings over a century old still serve various institutions of the State of Israel and thousands tourists from Russia make their way to Israel every year and discover the holy places.
Principal buildings erected by the IOPS (Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society), the Russian Church and the Russian Empire.

      Among the Arabic-speaking local population the church is known as Al-Moskobiya in the name of the pilgrims who built it, even though the central figures related to the deed came from other places in Russia. The pioneer and operator of this impressive church, as also of many other initiatives of the Russian Empire, is the Archim. Antonin Kapustin whose origins are from the province of Perm. The church commemorates the ascension of Jesus to the Heavens and in its center stands a bell tower 64 metes high. This bell, which weighs 5 tons, was the first to sound in Jerusalem after hundreds of years that the Muslim authorities prohibited Christians to ring church bells.
The journey of the church bell from Russia is depicted in a very poetic way in the book “Esau” by Meir Shalev - “four hundred and fifty pilgrims that dragged the enormous copper church bell to the church of Mary Magdalene (error in the source). The bell was cast in Odessa and placed on a reinforced cart built especially for this purpose. The men pulled it to the port. From there they sailed on the “Santa Ana” ship to Jaffa, and there the women made their way to the special cart. Since that very moment everybody kept silent, as they swore to do until the church bell is hung in its rightful place. A long time later one could distinguish the participants of the bell’s journey by their walking: strenuous pace with a hunched back, as if they were rowing against a strong wind”.

The tradition of finding John the Baptist’s head on the Mount of Olives:
One of the early Christian traditions determines that John the Baptist’s head was discovered on the Mount of Olives during the period of reign of Constantine Caesar of Rome. John the Baptist was beheaded because he rebuked King Herod for marrying Herodias, his brother’s wife; she had already given birth to a girl from his brother before the marriage. According to Torah (Pentateuch) laws, marrying a brother’s wife is permitted only in the case the brother passed away before bringing offspring to the world. According to the nuns’ tradition from the Russian monastery, Herodias did not enable the burial of John’s head together with the rest of his body; she hid the head in Herod’s palace as she feared that if his head was buried in the same place with his body, John would resurrect.

One of John’s students discovered the head and in the dead of night she smuggled away from the palace. Then, she concealed it in an ewer, which she buried on the Mount of Olives. Following this tradition, the head was revealed twice. The first time it was discovered by a wealthy man, Innocentius, who decided to distance himself from the world and lead an ascetic life and purchased a small plot of land on the Mount of Olives. At a certain point, when Innocentius decided to build himself a small church in his plot, he bumped into the ewer with the head. Prior to his last days, Innocentius buried the ewer at the same spot in which he found it. In 452 the same container was unearthed anew owing to a recurrent dream of two monks, both of whom saw John the Baptist thrice. In the dream, John explained to the monks where his head was buried. After the third time the monks were convinced, went on to search for the head and found it.

      info: `<b>The Church of Mary Magdalene</b>
      Mary Magdalene is depicted in the New Testament as one of Jesus’ central supporters, and is known as the “apostle of the apostles” (apostola apostolorum). As written in the Gospels, she was one of the women that were present during Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection.

Upon the land that was bought in the name of Tsar Alexander III in 1882, the church that became the crown jewel of Russian presence in the Holy Land was erected. Even before the completion of the construction of the church, it was written that “in this wonderful location there is a monument worthy of the royal family and Russia’s glory. The Catholic monks tear their robes out of jealousy”.

Archim. Kapustin, head of the Russian ecclesiastical mission, proposed to the Grand Dukes Sergey Alexandrovich and Pavel Alexandrovich the idea of the construction of a temple in memory their mother, Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna, during their visit in Jerusalem in May 1881. The works began in 1885 and in 1888 a dedication ceremony was carried out with the presence of the Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem, Grand Duke and chairman of the IOPS (Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society) Sergey Alexandrovich and his wife Princess Elizabeth Feodorovna, who requested to be buried at the site of the church.
*Opposite the church’s main entrance gate, inside the fence that surrounds the whole Gethsemane complex, an ancient stone column of unknown origin is positioned and it called the “Betrayal Column” or the “Kiss Column”. It stands there as a symbol of the place where Judas Iscariot kissed Jesus and therefore exposed him to the Roman soldiers, as recorded in the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament:

“Immediately while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came up accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs, who were from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, "Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him and lead Him away under guard." After coming, Judas immediately went to Him, saying, "Rabbi!" and kissed Him. They laid hands on Him and seized Him”.
Following the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, the Bolsheviks went after the royal family, a member of which was Elizabeth Feodorovna. Since her husband’s death, Elizabeth became a nun devoting all her being to the aid of others. She did not accept to leave Russia for her personal safety in order to remain with her fellow community members in Moscow. Elizabeth was caught by the Bolsheviks and after a whole year of house arrest she was brutally murdered. People still loyal to the Tsar found the Princess’ body, asked to arrange her a proper burial. Her body was first transferred to Siberia, later to the royal family’s graveyard in China and in 1920, under her young sister Victoria’s instruction and respecting Elizabeth’s own will, her remains were transferred for the last time to be buried in the church of Mary Magdalene. Elizabeth is recognized as a new saint for Russian Orthodoxy.`,

The courtyard was designed and built based on a German architect’s plans from Haifa, Gottlieb Schumacher.
In 1901 the cornerstone of the school was laid; for the first year of the school 35 pupils were registered. Russian activity and investments gradually escalating; the school became a teachers seminar for other schools founded in the Middle East and gradually more buildings were added such as an infirmary, a church, an artists studio and a hostel for pilgrims that could host 700 people at its peak. Following the assassination of the IOPS’s chairman Grand Duke Sergey Alexandrovich, the hostel in Nazareth received his name. Unsurprisingly, this area in Nazareth is called by locals al-Moskobiya. This building hosts today the municipality of Nazareth.

Owing to the unearthing of the findings, it was decided to erect a church in the aforementioned plot of land instead of the planned consulate. Archim. Kapustin together with the renowned archaeologist Conrad Schick continued the excavations, which revealed findings that correspond to the “Gates of Justice” literally portrayed in the New Testament, through which crucified Jesus passed to get to the hill of Golgotha to his death. In addition to the church, a monastery and hostel were built in Alexander’s Courtyard. The building is made of pink and red marble following the ablaq technique, typical of the Mameluke period.

      In 1857 the Ottomans were willing to sell to Russia a land plot of 68 square kilometers located adjacent to the old city walls to the west. The Tsar paid, as a matter of fact, for five sixths of the land value, and the remaining sixth was granted to him as a present by the Ottomans. This was an extraordinary move, because this plot outmatches the old city from a strategic point of view; it is very close to the central Jaffa road, and compelled the Ottoman authorities to vacate the square that was used for celebrations, ceremonies and military parades. Actually, the Russian Compound was the first site with great proximity to the old city walls in which the Ottomans permitted constructions. The vision of Russian Palestine begins to materialize in a prime location of developing Jerusalem.
The plan was to create a kind of a small town that serves Russian pilgrims that sojourn the Holy Land. It included the church of the Holy Trinity, a hospital, the hostels in honor of Maria and Elizabeth, a building hosting the ecclesiastical mission, the edifice of the Russian consulate and water reserves.

Currently the library is still active and contains over 17,000 titles. The building remains occupied by representatives of the Russian Church for more than 150 years, since its erection to this day. In this period of time the authority over the Land of Israel has changed hands several times, from Ottoman rule to the British mandate and finally the state of Israel.

      The “Women Pilgrims’ Hostel” named after Maria Feodorvna, wife of Tsar Alexander III and mother of  the last Tsar Nikolai II. The building was planned by the “house architect” Martin Ivanovich Eppinger. It consists of two square edifices connected to each other; in the middle of each square there is a yard, in which the female pilgrims would do laundry and get warm under the sun, since the building’s thick walls caused the rooms to be especially cool.
The construction of the complex was completed in 1864 and, apart from the hostel and the yards, there were two kitchens in the complex that served hot simple meals. The guesthouse area was very basic and included big spaces that contained tens of beds.
In the summer of 1914, during WWI, the complex was conquered by the German command; the monks, priests and the rest of the people of the church were allowed to return to their country of origin, while the female pilgrims were thrown to the streets in just in their nightgowns upon their skin. The women pilgrims’ hostel became a stable for the horses of the German corps, who fought side by side with the Ottomans. By the end of 1917, after Britain’s victory, the English set their headquarters on the grounds of the Russian Compound and converted Maria’s courtyard to a jail.

During the period of the British Mandate the place served as a detention center and approximately a hundred Arab prisoners were hanged on its grounds. Many of the prisoners coming from Jewish underground organizations were also imprisoned in that detention center, but were not executed. Two Jewish prisoners who were about to get hanged there (Moshe Barazani and Meir Feinstein) commited suicide using a grenade before their execution, so that they do not die in their captors’ hands.

On the day of its inauguration the hospital has at its disposal 35 hospital beds and brand-new equipment. In spite of the fact that the hospital was supposed to serve the Russian pilgrims, its gates were open to all people who needed treatment and aid. The number of beds gradually rose to 75 and towards the end of the 19th century the hospital was the biggest one in the city. Following WWI, during the British mandate, the hospital constituted the central state hospital of the authorities in charge. Later, during the Independence War, the hospital served the IDF as a military hospital, and following the establishment of the State of Israel, it got the Hebrew name Avihail and served as a laboratory for Hadasa hospital and after that as a mortuary.

The church, built using white stone, has eight towers and on top of each a dome; all eight domes were painted green for a long period of time but currently they have been coated with copper and crosses have been placed on top of them. The church bears great similarity to the Ascension Convent located in the Kremlin in Moscow.

      Initially the church was built for the use of the pilgrims hosted in one of the hostels of the Russian Compound. The assumption was that the pilgrims will prefer to have their important prayers in the historic churches in the old city. Therefore, the church is relatively not very big, and actually it is the smallest edifice as far as surface area is concerned out of all the constructions carried out in the Russian Compound. However, its height, position and luxurious style turn it into a remarkable edifice.

In 1887, using funds he raised by himself, Benjamin opened a hostel in the Jewish quarter in the old city. Contrary to the seasonal hostels (pilgrimage season usually stretches from October to May) of the IOPS, Benjamin’s hostel was intended to be a kind of shelter for people who wanted to spend the rest of their days in Jerusalem; in return of a minimal payment every person could let a room. There were also shared rooms in the hostel in which the people of the IOPS could stay free of charge. The monk Benjamin was very dear to the clergy and his funeral was performed in the church of the Holy Trinity. He passed the ownership of his hostel to the IOPS and wrote the rights of the asset to the chairman of the Society, Sergey Alexandrovich.

Over the course of many years the building housed the NGO “Yad Sarah”.

Later, as happened in Nazareth, the school became a teachers seminar (female), the building was expanded and in it an ambulatory clinic, a hostel and a chapel were arranged.

Upon the completion of their journey to Palestine that lasted at least two weeks on board, the pilgrims would get a warm welcome in Russian in the church that included a hot meal at a symbolic price and a common prayer to commence their quests in the Holy Land.
On the church grounds one can also find the grave of Tabitha, or Tzvia in Hebrew, a Christian saintly figure, one of the first individuals to believe in Jesus during his lifetime.
“Now in Jaffa there was a disciple named Tabitha, which translates as Tzvia; this woman was abounding with deeds of kindness and charity which she continually did”.
St. Peter, after whom the church is named, was one of the 12 apostles and, according to Orthodox faith, this is the location where he resurrected Tabitha.
“But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed, and turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. And he gave her his hand and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. It became known all over Jaffa, and many believed in the Lord” - from the New Testament.
